  <h1>📃 Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 13, 2026</p>

  <p>At <span class="accent">Bookshelf</span>, we are dedicated to providing a safe, transparent, and enjoyable experience for all book enthusiasts. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data to ensure your privacy while offering a feature-rich environment built with modern Android technologies.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection & Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We respect your privacy and do <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information directly. To provide a high-quality service, we utilize trusted third-party providers that may collect anonymized usage data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Books API</strong>: Used to fetch book metadata, descriptions, and covers. No personal data is sent to this service.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: Displays non-personalized banner and interstitial ads to support the app's free availability. Google may use anonymized identifiers to serve ads and measure performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong>: Facilitates secure transactions for premium feature purchases. We do not store your payment information directly.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics</strong>: Helps us monitor app stability, diagnose crashes, and understand usage patterns to improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</strong>: Used to deliver book recommendations and optional updates. You can manage notification permissions through your system settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Local Data Persistence</h2>
  <p>For a seamless and responsive experience, certain information is stored locally on your device. This data remains on your device and is not uploaded to our servers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Jetpack DataStore</strong>: Stores your application preferences, such as theme selection (Light/Dark/System) and connectivity settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Room Database</strong>: Caches your favorite books ("My Books") and recent search results to ensure fast access and offline availability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Content Safety & Moderation</h2>
  <p>Bookshelf is designed to be a safe platform for readers of all ages. We implement automated filtering based on API metadata to exclude books with mature, violent, or sensitive themes. While we strive for 100% accuracy, we encourage users to report any concerns to our support email.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>The Bookshelf app is built with security in mind. We do not require account creation, logins, or access to sensitive device permissions (such as contacts or location). All network requests are conducted over secure (HTTPS) connections.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy periodically to reflect changes in our services or legal requirements. Updated versions will be posted here, and major changes will be highlighted in the app's "About" section.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact us at:<br>
