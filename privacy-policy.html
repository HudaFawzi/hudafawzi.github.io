  <h1>ðŸ“ƒ Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 12, 2025</p>

  <p>Bookshelf is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the Bookshelf app for Android.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personally identifiable information directly from users.</p>
  <p>However, we use third-party services that may collect certain data automatically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Books API</strong>: Used to fetch book data. No user-identifiable information is sent.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: Displays banner ads and may collect anonymized data to provide relevant advertising.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Books API</strong><br>
      Used to retrieve public book data including titles, authors, and images.<br>
      Data fetched is not linked to you personally.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob (Ads)</strong><br>
      We show non-personalized banner ads to help support the appâ€™s free availability.<br>
      Google may use cookies or identifiers to show relevant ads and measure performance.<br>
      For more information, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Child-Friendly Content Filtering</h2>
  <p>To provide a safe and modest experience for users of all ages, especially children, the Bookshelf app automatically filters out books that contain adult, violent, or political themes. This filtering is based on metadata such as book categories and descriptions retrieved from the Google Books API. While we strive to exclude inappropriate content, we cannot guarantee that all filtered results will be completely free from sensitive material due to third-party data limitations.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>The Bookshelf app does not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect or store personal data</li>
    <li>Require user accounts or login</li>
    <li>Access sensitive device permissions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All network requests are limited to retrieving publicly available book information or displaying ads via Google AdMob.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy periodically. You will be notified of any major changes by updating this document and optionally through the appâ€™s About section.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
